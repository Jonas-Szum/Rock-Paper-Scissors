Like my last program, the client and prog3 folders will work if you just insert them into your 
eclipse-workspace folder. The test cases are included in those folders, but also copied into the folder
called casesForBoth. This program was my first attempt at multithreading.

The pictures go in order of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.

Working this project requires two clients and one server. The UI should be straight-forward, but make sure to
turn on the server before trying to have the players connect. The package I was using doesn't allow for
clean shutdown and startup of a server, so if you want to restart, you have to stop the server process manually
and re-open it.
